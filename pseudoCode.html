There are 3 ingredient cupboards that each have a form with radio checkboxes inside. Radio to prevent choosing more than one choice per cupboard. There is a cauldron on the left side of the page. 

User will choose an ingredient(icon) from each cupboard "checking a radio checkbox" 

Each ingredient will have a mad-libs type value attached to it, hidden from the user (object?).

These values will be entered into a string  `This potion will give you ${ingredientA}. You can also expect ${ingredientB}. Be wary of ${ingredientC} as it is a common side effect of these items brewed together. Happy casting`

1 form, 3 sections
a submit button

look at queenstreet_hottreat exercise as example as well as mad-libs 

3 radio sets with the same name each (potionIng1, potionIng2, potionIng3) in one form.

use .val() to keep info from an input. It's a getter
